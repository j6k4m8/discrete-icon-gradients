# Discrete-Icon-Gradient
A LESS mixin collection that allows you to show a partially-filled texticon.

Perfect for when you have an icon of signal-bars or such and want to fill some but not all of them. Allows for partially-transparent 'missing' bars, your own fallbacks, etc. Should be pretty cross-compatible, but no promises.
